# What is Insurance?

The purpose of having insurance is to manage your risk. When you buy insurance, you're protected against unpredictable financial losses. The insurance company pays you, or someone is chosen by you, if something unexpected happens. If you're not insured and accidents happen, you may be responsible for all costs associated with the accident.

# Why Do I Need Insurance?

There are scenarios where it's beneficial to have insurance, many are very important, and some are mandatory. Ultimately people pay insurance to manage risk. As human beings, you can't control what happens in life, but you can protect yourself and your loved ones by having insurance. The types of insurance you need depend on your lifestyle, job, location, family status, etc.

# What Are the Most Common Types of Insurance

While we can't control the unpredictable things that happen in life, insurance safeguards us financially. There are three types of insurance everyone needs:

# Health Insurance

In Canada your provincial government pays for most of your medical expenses, but not everything. Dental coverage, prescriptions and eye care, and mental health-related expenses are not included. Some employers help you to fill the gaps, and some will ask their employees to pay premiums.

## Home Insurance

Home insurance is not legally required, if you fully own the home. But in order to qualify for the mortgage, home buyers are required to have home insurance.

One common mistake people make is not getting home insurance in case of fire or any other unexpected incident, they turn to their family and friends to raise money to rebuild their home.

Home insurance is vital in protecting your home from fire, theft or unpredictable damage.

### The Different Types of Home Insurance

1. Comprehensive home insurance: Cover loss of property or its content, you’ll pay more, but you will be grateful if anything happens.
2. Broad Insurance: Falls between comprehensive and basic insurance- it covers your property with its identified content.
3. Basic or named Perils: You can pick and choose what property or contents should be covered by the insurance.
4. Personal Liabilities: covers if someone injures themself on your property.
5. Mortgage insurance: Allows potential homebuyers to purchase a home with five percent down payment. This type of insurance protects the lender and the investors if the buyer defaults.
6. Title Insurance: When buying a home, its title is transferred to your name; having title insurance means you have legal ownership of the property. Title insurance protects the homeowner and their lenders from any challenges to that title, for example, pre-existing defects or liens on the property.
7. Tenant Insurance: Some rental or independent landlords will require tenants to have tenant insurance, but not all. Tenant insurance covers a variety of things, depending on your selections, such as content, personal liabilities, replacement cost and living expenses (if you have to evacuate your space in event of claim).

# Life Insurance

One of the biggest factors of Life Insurance is to cover your funeral expenses and provide for those you leave behind. This is especially important if you have a family dependent on your income to pay bills and survive.

When estimating the amount of life insurance coverage, consider the following: your funeral expenses and your daily expenses, including mortgage payments, outstanding loans, credit card debt, tax, childcare, and college tuition for the future.

Two basic types of life insurance are traditional whole life and term life insurance.

1. Whole life insurance: Permanent life insurance can be used as an income tool and insurance instrument as long as you pay the premium monthly, your whole is covered until you die.
2. Term life insurance: is a policy that covers you for a specific or set amount of time. A few factors to consider are your age, job and number of dependent children.

# Mandatory Insurance That You Need

Auto insurance.

You're required to have car insurance if you're driving a vehicle in Canada.

- BC, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan car insurance are through provincial government-owned corporations.
- Quebec handles minimum limits for bodily injuries, and the private sector covers the property damage.
- For the rest of Canada, car insurance is offered by private companies.
